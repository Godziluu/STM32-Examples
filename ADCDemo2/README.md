# STM32-Examples
#
# Programming examples with the STM32F334 chip or nucleo board
#
# all examples use initialization code generated by the ST CubeMX software in HAL mode
# the CubeMX project file is included
# programs have been developped with VisualGDB which regenerates the makefiles each time
#
# example 1)
# I2C: drive a I2C PCF8574T chip itself driving a HD44780  16x2 lines LCD display
# the only caveat with the STM32 is that the slave address should be shifted 1 bit
# 
# This is a port of the arduino libraries, where the only major change is in the I2CIO.cpp
# 
#
# example 2)
# TestADC2: goes further than the visualGDB tutorial, it also uses the second ADC channel
# and uses the high resoution timer to drive the ADC sampling.
